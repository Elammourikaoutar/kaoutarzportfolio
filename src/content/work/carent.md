LUXE CAR RENT is a web portal that boosts all stages of your rental business and the management of your car fleet that includes some of the biggest brands such as Audi, Range Rover, Mercedes and Porsche. From an intuitive and customizable interface, app admins can quickly record or edit customer orders and vehicles and visitors can make reservations and rental invoices in seconds.

The application is divided into two parts:

Part 1: Admin Area
The admin area brings together a set of administrative tasks to manage the stock of cars as well as customers' rental reservations. In order to access it, admins must log in to the site by entering their registration information.

Part 2: Customer or visitor area
The site includes dynamic pages rich in content, which illustrates in detail the service offered by the rental agency Luxe Car Rent, its history, its professional recommendations with these customers, its catalog of luxury cars and a contact interface that allows the visitor to contact directly the administrative team of the company
