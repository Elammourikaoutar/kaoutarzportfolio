This project concerns the creation of a video game based on the rules of a "War Game".
The objective of this game is to make an interface that contains a main player who willdefend against enemies (dragons) who bring flames to Earth.

- The main player will fire shots with a weapon;
- The weapon is a part of the main player that is synchronized with the position of the player.
- You can move the player as well as manipulate the shots of his weapon.
- Once the shot hits the enemy, they will disappear from the interface with
  confusion that will be generated by a sound.
- Dragons randomly breathe fire while moving in their area
  with a circular movement shape.
- The player has 3 lives, if one of the flames hits the player, he will lose one life whose confusion will be generated with a sound.

Here's a video that present the interface of this game : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Kfukd_LziITtYGRWloePglAj26krtg_y
